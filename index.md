  <div><p>A great deal of still being researched on detection of hate speech, offensive, and aggressive behavior on social media. Existing work is mainly focused on user or tweet level analysis in detecting the harassing content. Even though, that kind of analysis has a huge impact on detecting toxic behaviour, they do not provide truly accurate analysis all the time due to the different intentions of the users. We introduce a novel approach that adopts interaction based analysis where we investigate harassing interactions rather than harassing tweets. We have observed that individual tweets do not provide enough evidence for toxic behaviour; hence aggregating tweets for each interaction provide context to make a determination.</p>
  <p>In this project, I have detected online toxic behavior on social media platforms, performing creation, curation, filtering, and processing of a novel interaction-level dataset containing potentially toxic content, from raw Twitter data in Python</p>

      I have also extracted emojis and urls from tweets to perform multi-modal analysis over emoji, and image data in interactions between users

<b> - [Classification of user types in marijuana-related communications on Twitter](https://github.com/halo91cs/Marujana_Project)</b>

<p>As social media has become an emerging medium to share information in last decade, it has been used by individuals to express their opinions on issues concerning the public. While analysis of this data on social media enabled researchers and analysts to assess the public opinion, it introduced challenges to probable solutions. Legalization of usage of marijuana the collected social media data can be from ordinary personal users or non-personal users such as retail and media. Since we can accurately measure the public opinion on marijuana legalization based on the content of personal users, we need to separate them from non-personal accounts. In this study, I classify users on Twitter into two categories (personal and non-personal) using their profile images since it has been shown that profile picture is an important indicator of the type of a user. I have used an annotated dataset comprising Twitter users, of which are personal users. The dataset was annotated by domain experts in the field of drug abuse and epidemiology, through visiting user profiles on Twitter and looking at their tweets, profile information and profile pictures.</p>
